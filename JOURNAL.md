### General idea

Essentially a nixie tube clock with GPS syncronization. I also want to give it a case out of laser cut aluminum and *maybe* some laser cut wood, I need to do some more research. 

### Powahhhhhhh

Nixie tubes operate at 170v, I'm planning to use [this](https://omnixie.com/products/nch8200hv-nixie-hv-power-module?variant=36238768242855) and have a bunch of shift registers to actually drive them.
